# Reverse Engineering Code
__PROJECT14: 12 JUNE 2020__
<br>
https://github.com/Ryuku72/14ReverseEngineering/blob/master/Homework%20W14.pdf


## Aim
Reverse engineer the starter code provided and create a written tutorial. 

### Business Context
When joining a new team, you will be expected to inspect a lot of code that you have never seen before. Rather than having a team member explain every line for you, you will dissect the code by yourself, saving any questions for a member of your team.

## Build Process 
Unlike previous projects that focused on building a working example, PROJECT14 shifted scope to documentation and analysis. However, to understand the code I need to break down the starter code into 4 separate sections that highlighted a particular area (server, routes, passport and Sequelize).

As I broke down the code into these 4 sections I offered a key aim for each folder in order to indicate that the project was working and indicate that I understood why I had broken down the code in such a manner.

## Project Issues 
Documentation is a known issue in the coding community and create a good tutorial is difficult without prior knowledge of how to write a good tutorial. Currently I feel the project is too long and there would be a better method to this madness but overall I hope the document does indicate I understand how Passport works within a Web Application.

## Future updates
Page 16: Additions does highlight to key outstanding issues within the code. Going forward I would want to take this knowledge and apply it to a Google or Facebook authentication app.
